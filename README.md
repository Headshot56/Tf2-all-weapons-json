# Tf2-all-weapons-json
I made a json of all tf2 weapons not including skins! You're welcome.

I was trying to do some tf2 related code projects and i needed a list of all the weapons and i was expecting to find a json or a plain text list just on a link first page of google.
But after looking for awhile i just said screw it and manually made a list and then webscraped a json and manually filtered out and cleaned up(took a few houirs of boring ctrl-c ctrl-v)
but here you go so enjoy!
